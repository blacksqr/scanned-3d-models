Introduction
============
Volfill is a program for filling holes in volumetric data sets.  The 
program was written to read in and output .vri files, but there is nothing 
preventing this program from working with other file formats.

The volfill program fills in holes using a technique called volumetric 
diffusion. The program was designed to be run on large data sets (such as 
the David), and because of this, uses run length encoding to store the 
volumetric data. In order to speed up processing, two criteria are used to 
decide on whether data should be blended. One measures distance from an 
active edge (d2) and the other measures the distance from a newly created 
edge (d1). Each voxel stores its corresponding d1 and d2 value. D2 is set 
to zero when a voxel has an opposite signed neighbor as well as an empty 
neighbor. D1 is set to zero when a voxel has an opposite signed neighbor 
and is newly created data. For other voxels, their d1 and d2 values are 
the minimum value of all of their neighbors plus one. 

Compilation
===========
To compile the program simply type make in the same directory as the 
source code and makefile.  The makefile and program were written for 
Linux.

Running the Program
===================
The usage for volfill is 

volfill input.vri output.vri ... 'optional parameters'
Where optional parameters are 

-g for graphical display 
-n 'iterations' to specify the number of iterations to blur 
-d1 'd1 distance' to specify the d1 distance 
-d2 'd2 distance' to specify the d2 distance 
-p to propgate d2 distances to max before blurring 

Graphical Mode Use
==================
Volfill also comes with a graphical display that can be used to visualize 
a slice of the voxel grid. It is activated with the -g command line option. 
OpenGL and glut is required to use the graphical mode. If you would like to 
compile the program without these libraries, simply comment out the glut 
function calls in main.cc and in fb.cc. 

When in the graphical mode, the following keys are used to perform actions 
	'b' to blur the voxel grid one time 
	'l' to perform n blurs (where n is a command line parameter, or default) 
	'w' to output the grid to a file 
	'a' to move up one slice in the grid 
	's' to move down one slice in the grid 
	'm' to output n ppm files 
	'1' visualization of the voxel data values 
	'2' visualization of the d1 values 
	'3' visualization of the d2 values 
	'4' visualization of all values
